# AR-MoodBoard-Immersive

MoodBoard Immersive is a cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) prototype designed for design companies, developed using Meta Spark Studio. This innovative tool allows clients to virtually step into their moodboard and see it come to life in their surroundings. The prototype enables users to access a virtual room where they can experiment with different floor and wall colors by tapping on materials displayed on the screen. This functionality is aimed at simplifying the decision-making process, boosting confidence in design choices, and streamlining the overall design workflow.
